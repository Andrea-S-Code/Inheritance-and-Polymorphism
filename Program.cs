//1. Take a few sentences to give an example of why you would use Inheritance. 
//Do the same for polymorphism. You can put these answers in the .cs file as comments.
// 1) Inheritance:You would use inheritance to create a general class that defines a common set for a general class. 
//This class can then be inherited by other, more specific classes, each adding those things that are unique to it.
//Polymorphism: used when you need to define one interface and have multiple implementations for it
